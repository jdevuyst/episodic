  "Start a new episode in which notes (see note) and post-its (see post) can be
  logged for varying log levels. At the end of the episode, a log level is
  selected depending on whether or not an exception was thrown. The notes and
  post-its are then compiled into a single mapâ€”the summary.

  The first vector is a mandatory tag (to identify the kind of episode) and an
  optional map of options. If an option is omitted here then tag-options or
  global-options is consulted.

  Options:
  - :retrow - false, true, or a function
  - :log-level-normal is the log level for when no exception is thrown
  - :log-level-error is the log level when an exception is thrown
  - :executor ThreadPoolExecutor for writing the summary
  - :merge Reducer for compiling the summary
  - :get-writer Function from summaries to a java.io.Writer object
  - :print Function that, given a summary, prints to *out*

  If :rethrow is false then exceptions are contained within the episode. If true
  then the exception is rethrown (after wrapping with ex-info). The value for
  :rethrow can also be a unary function that is called with the summary if an
  exception is thrown."
